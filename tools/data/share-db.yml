goals: Facilitate the process of data sharing among industry, academia, and government (Metadata Research Center, 2018). The project has three interconnected components - a licensing framework/generator; a data sharing platform,called ShareDB, to enforce some of the privacy and compliance aspects of the licenses; and robust metadata for the datasets as well as the developed licenses, to communicate data handling and rights specifications in a machine-readable way.
