## Contributing to the directory

### [Adding a Standard, Tool or Community Initiative](https://metadata-research.github.io/data-sharing-directory/)

To add a new entry to one of the following categories: Standards, Tools, or Community Initiatives (or to edit an existing entry), begin by forking the repository to create your own copy of the directory, adding (or editing) the entry, committing your additions/changes, and submitting a pull request to the original repository.

1. Sign into your GitHub account.
   If you don't have one, here's how to [set one up](https://github.com/join)

2. Fork the repository using the button at the upper right. The fork button looks like this:
   
   You have just created a copy of the directory for your personal use. The changes you make here will not be final
   until you have submitted them as a pull request, and the pull    request has been merged into the origin repository
   by a repo maintainer. More on pull requests below. 
   After forking, the URL for your repository should look something like the following:
   github.com/[your-user-name]/data-sharing-directory/tree/gh-pages

   And the title of the directory at the top of your page should be: 
   [your-user-name]/data-sharing-directory
