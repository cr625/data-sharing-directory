title: International Virtual Observatory Alliance Technical Specifications
slug: international-virtual-observatory-alliance-technical-specifications
description: >-
  <p>The technical specifications defined by the IVOA (International Virtual
  Observatory Alliance) enable interoperability between and the integration of
  astronomical archives across the world into an international virtual
  observatory. They include several data models that act as metadata schemas for
  particular data types: for example, photometry data, simulation data,
  space-time coordinates, spectral lines data, spectral data, observational
  data, and the physical parameter space of astronomical datasets.</p><p>These
  data models are under active development by the IVOA Data Modelling Working
  Group.</p><p>Additional recommendations have been made for metadata concepts
  and terms necessary for the discovery and the use of astronomical data
  collections and services.</p>
