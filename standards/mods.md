description: |
  <p>The Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) is a bibliographic metadata
  standard implemented in XML. It reimplements a subset of the elements of MARC
  (Machine Readable Cataloging) using language-based tags instead of numeric
  ones, and groups them somewhat differently. It is intended both as a
  simplified version of MARC 21 and as a richer alternative to Dublin Core for
  applications such as metadata syndication/harvesting and the documentation of
  digital information packages.</p><p>It was developed in 2002 by the Library
  of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office along with a group
  of interested experts.</p>
