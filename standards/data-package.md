description: >-
  <p>The Data Package specification is a generic wrapper format for exchanging
  data. Although it supports arbitrary metadata, the format defines required,
  recommended, and optional fields for both the package as a whole and the
  resources contained within it.</p><p>A separate but linked specification
  provides a way to describe the columns of a data table; descriptions of this
  form can be included directly in the Data Package metadata.</p>
