description: |
  <p>MARC is a standard and serialization format for representing bibliographic metadata, originally designed as a way of exchanging bibliographic records between library catalogs. Various different versions have been defined, mostly with national or regional scope, of which MARC 21 is probably the most widely used. There also exists an XML serialization of MARC 21, known as MARCXML.</p>
