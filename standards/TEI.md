description: |
  <p>The guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative make recommendations about suitable ways 
  of representing those features of textual resources which need to be identified explicitly 
  in order to facilitate processing by computer programs. They specify a set of XML tags
  in order to mark the textual metadata, text structure, relationship between images and transcriptions 
  and other features of interest. The guidelines both describe the formal TEI encoding scheme, and document
  the TEI markup vocabulary. In their 30 years community driven development they have developed to a de-facto 
  standard in the production of textual data in the humanities.</p>
