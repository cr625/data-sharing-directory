Goals: Develop a set of free copyright licenses that reduce barriers to creativity, yet also specify conditions for acceptable use (Creative Commons, 2017a).

Status: At the time of writing, there are seven types of Creative Commons license or dedication options, with specifications for sharing, attribution, derivative works (remixing), and commercial use permissions. The six licensing options are: Attribution (CC BY), Attribution Share-Alike (CC BY-SA), Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND), Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC), Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA), and Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND). The seventh and most recently-developed addition to Creative Commons is CC ∅ (CC Zero), released in 2009, which is a “no rights reserved” public domain waiver option, as a means to unambiguously provide unfettered re-use possibilities as fully as the licensor can (Creative Commons, 2017b). In addition, the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language (ccREL) was proposed by Creative Commons in 2008, but has not yet been endorsed by the W3 (W3C, 2008). Applied through the use of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, ccREL is a machine-readable way to express licensing metadata (W3C, 2008).
