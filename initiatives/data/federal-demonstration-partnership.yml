goals: The broad goal of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), a cooperative effort among 10 United States federal agencies and 154 institutional federal funding recipients, is to mitigate administrative loads related to research grants and contracts (The Federal Demonstration Partnership, 2018). As it relates to data stewardship, the FDP has conducted a Data Transfer and Use Agreement pilot towards the creation of data transfer and use agreement templates (The Federal Demonstration Partnership, 2018). These templates were developed to reduce the complex and time-consuming process of crafting individualized data transfer and use agreements for each research collaboration.
