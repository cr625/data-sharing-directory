## Rights and Licenses

The Data Sharing Rights and Licenses Directory is an open list of data sharing agreements and related tools, standards and community initiatives used among industry, academia, government, and nonprofits. It was developed by Information Science researchers and software developers at Drexel University's Metadata Research Center, at the College of Computing and Informatics. This project was undertaken as part of the NSF Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub data sharing initiative, A Licensing Model and Ecosystem for Data Sharing.

The Metadata Research Center (MRC) located at the College of Computing & Informatics (CCI), Drexel University, leads and innovates metadata solutions for pressing information/data-oriented challenges. Metadata, semantics, and ontologies are vital for effectively and efficiently using and manipulating data. The MRC is committed to advancing research in these areas, formalizing metadata-driven methods and approaches, and vitalizing our capacities for using data across all sectors.
