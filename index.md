## Data Sharing Directory: Standards, Tools, and Community Initiatives

The Data Sharing Directory is an open list of data sharing standards, tools, and community initiatives that aid data sharing among industry, academia, government, and nonprofits. This project was undertaken as part of the Metadata Research Center’s work on the project, “A Licensing Model and Ecosystem for Data Sharing,” (NSF #1636788), with the NSF Northeast *[Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/).

The *[Metadata Research Center](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/) (MRC) located at the College of Computing & Informatics (CCI), Drexel University, leads and innovates metadata solutions for pressing information/data-oriented challenges. Metadata, semantics, and ontologies are vital for effectively and efficiently using and manipulating data. The MRC is committed to advancing research in these areas, formalizing metadata-driven methods and approaches, and vitalizing our capacities for using data across all sectors.
